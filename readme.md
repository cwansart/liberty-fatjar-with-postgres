# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

This is an example project to get the PostgreSQL jdbc driver inside the executable fatjar generated by the liberty-maven-plugin.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command

    mvn clean package

This will create an executable jar file **liberty-fatjar-with-postgres.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/liberty-fatjar-with-postgres.jar
